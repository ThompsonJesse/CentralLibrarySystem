-Check/finish the append_required_fields function in Helpers.php
-Add a check for fine to the check_out function for Patrons
-Write get functions for various fields
-Is there an instance where we do not want to basically return an entire record (excepting patron and librarian)? 

- There are a lot of errors that were not visible in the old version of testfile (now color-coded). We should figure out what to do about everything in red.

-error in get_item_by_mediaitem_id function,
     checking !$result doesn't check if theres no tags,
     so the conditional body is in the wrong place
	
- check_in()	needed implementation : is overdue -> make fine
