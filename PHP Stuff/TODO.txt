-Check/finish the append_required_fields function in Helpers.php
-Add a check for fine to the check_out function for Patrons
-Write get functions for various fields

- There are a lot of errors that were not visible in the old version of testfile (now color-coded). We should figure out what to do about everything in red.
	
- I think we have a lot of repeated code that maybe should be functions, such as
	- userid_exists(userid)
	- hardcopy_exists(barcode)
	- hardcopy_exists(mediaitemid)
	- mediaitem_exists(mediaitemid)
